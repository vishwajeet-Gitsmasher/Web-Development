    <h1>Using Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML</h1>
    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."<strong>//this is a blockquoted text </strong></p>

    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: <strong>//this is paragraph </strong></p>

    <p>"To keep your balance, you must keep moving."<strong>//this is quoted text</strong></p>

    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <em>Albert Einstein.</em><strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong></p>

    <p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <em>Pride and Prejudice</em><strong>//this is a citation tag. </strong> <br>
    by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.</p>

    
    <p>Another classic example can be seen in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em><strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong><br>
    by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.</p>
